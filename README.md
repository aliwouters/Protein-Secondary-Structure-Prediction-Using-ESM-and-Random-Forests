# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Prediction-Using-ESM-and-Random-Forests
This project focused on predicting the secondary structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences. Representations were extracted using Meta AIâ€™s ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling), a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model. These embeddings were used as input features for a Random Forest classifier to assign secondary structure labels (e.g., helix, strand, turn) to individual amino acids. The final predictions were evaluated using Codabench, with the model achieving strong performance by combining deep learning-based representations with classical machine learning techniques.
